Generating JSON as a string You can generate an ARM template as a plain string:
let json = deployment.Template |&amp;gt; Writer.toJson // prints out the JSON printfn &amp;#34;%s&amp;#34; json Writing to a file You can write out the ARM template directly to a file, from which you can then deploy to Azure using whichever mechanism you already use e.g. Azure CLI, Powershell, REST API etc.</description></item><item><title>App Insights</title><link>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/app-insights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:53:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/app-insights/</guid><description>Overview The App Insights builder is used to create Application Insights accounts.

This won&amp;rsquo;t be an introduction to Azure Resource Manager or ARM templates. Instead let&amp;rsquo;s go through the main parts that are important for creating a new resource.
The main parts of ARM Templates can be broken into resources, outputs, variables, and parameters.

Farmer, by design, has only limited support for parameters and no support for variables. We don&amp;rsquo;t plan on adding rich support for either of these for the following reasons:
We want to keep the Farmer codebase simple for maintainers We want to keep the Farmer API simple for users We want to keep the generated ARM templates as readable as possible We feel that instead of trying to embed conditional logic and program flow directly inside ARM templates in JSON, if you wish to parameterise your template that you should use a real programming language to do that: in this case, F#.</description></item><item><title>Cosmos DB</title><link>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/cosmosdb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:53:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/cosmosdb/</guid><description>Overview The CosmosDb package containers two builders, used to create databases and containers.

In such cases, we
An IBuilder is not only even easier to consume by users than the F# record above, but can create multiple IArmResource objects at once.

If you wish to create multiple hubs in the same namespace, configure the namespace-level properties in the first event hub; subsequent event hubs should link to the namespace of the hub created by the first hub.</description></item><item><title>5.
