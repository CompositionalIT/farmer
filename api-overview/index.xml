Generating JSON as a string You can generate an ARM template as a plain string:
let json = deployment.Template |&amp;gt; Writer.toJson // prints out the JSON printfn &amp;#34;%s&amp;#34; json Writing to a file You can write out the ARM template directly to a file, from which you can then deploy to Azure using whichever mechanism you already use e.g. Azure CLI, Powershell, REST API etc.</description></item><item><title>Parameters and Variables</title><link>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/parameters/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 09:13:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/parameters/</guid><description>ARM templates support the idea both of parameterisation of templates and of the use of variables within a template for e.g. placeholders and re-using values.
Farmer, by design, has only limited support for parameters and no support for variables. We don&amp;rsquo;t plan on adding rich support for either of these for the following reasons:
We want to keep the Farmer codebase simple for maintainers We want to keep the Farmer API simple for users We want to keep the generated ARM templates as readable as possible We feel that instead of trying to embed conditional logic and program flow directly inside ARM templates in JSON, if you wish to parameterise your template that you should use a real programming language to do that: in this case, F#.</description></item><item><title>ARM Expressions</title><link>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/expressions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 09:13:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/expressions/</guid><description>ARM template expressions are a way of safely storing string values which contain expressions that are evaluated at deployment time by the Azure. ARM expressions can also contain a set of predefined functions supported by the ARM runtime. They can be passed back as outputs and used further downstream
Farmer understands how to use ARM expressions and provides functionality to correctly wrap and unwrap them as raw strings into a JSON template.</description></item></channel></rss>
