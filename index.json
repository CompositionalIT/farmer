Farmer is commercially supported, open source and free-to-use.\nFor those of you working with Azure today, you may already be aware that one of the most useful features is the ability to generate entire infrastructure architectures as code via ARM Template files. These templates contain a declarative model that allows repeatable deployments and idempotent releases (among other things).\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s wrong with ARM? Unfortunately, ARM templates have some limitations caused by the fact that they must be authored in a verbose JSON dialect:\n They provide very limited type checking and support, which makes creating discovery and creation of template features difficult. Templates need a lot of boilerplate to be created for even relatively simple and common resources. It requires \u0026ldquo;embedded\u0026rdquo;, difficult-to-maintain stringly-typed code in order to achieve what might be trivial in a \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; programming language, such as references, variables and parameters - or writing elements such as loops. The documentation for ARM templates is not always kept up-to-date, so understanding and learning how to properly use them can involve a lot of searching and trial-and-error.  In other words, whilst working with ARM templates that have already been created is relatively straightforward, the authoring of the templates themselves is time-consuming and error-prone.\nWhilst there have been some recent improvements to ARM - including tooling improvements in VS Code through an extension - we think that we can do much better than relying on tooling for a specific IDE, which means using something different than JSON when directly authoring ARM templates.\nWhat does Farmer do to fix this? Farmer templates are simple .NET Core applications which reference the Farmer NuGet package. This package contains a set of types that model Azure resources in a strongly-typed and succinct fashion, as well as functionality to create ARM templates from this model - and even deploy directly to Azure.\nWhat can I use Farmer for?

These resources are added by Farmer to the resources array you can see above.\nWhen building up a resource it will have a schema that looks something like this.\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-example-resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-05-01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;location\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;westeurope\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;sku\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;S1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;adminUserEnabled\u0026#34;: true, }, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [] } Your resource you create will have a type of service that it represents. Each service has many versions, represented by a date. Typically your builder will at first focus on adding properties to the properties field to configure a service to be deployed in a certain state.\nWhere can I find docs on ARM templates schemas themselves? There are three good sources to learning about specific ARM resources and what parts need to be used in creating an equivalent Farmer resource:\n Reference Docs: The reference documentation contains details on the schema for every resource and every version e.g. Container Registry reference. Sample Template: The Azure Quickstart Templates github repository contains many examples of real-world ARM templates e.g. Container Registry with Geo Replication sample. Reverse engineer: You can manually create a required resource in Azure, and then use Azure\u0026rsquo;s export ARM template functionality to create an ARM template.

To manipulate such values, you can use standard F# and .NET capabilities.\n How do I use ARM expressions? Many Farmer builders contain pre-defined ARM expression that can be used for common tasks, such as passing a connection string from a storage account as a KeyVault secret, or a web application setting.\nAs an example, a Storage Account config contains a Key member that you can supply to a web app as a setting:\nlet storageConfig = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;myStorageAccount\u0026#34; } let webAppConfig = webApp { name \u0026#34;myWebApp\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;storageKey\u0026#34; storageConfig.Key } This will be written to the ARM template file as follows:\n\u0026#34;appSettings\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;storageKey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[concat(\u0026#39;DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myStorageAccount;AccountKey=\u0026#39;, listKeys(\u0026#39;myStorageAccount\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2017-10-01\u0026#39;).keys[0].value)]\u0026#34; } Using ARM expressions means that you can deploy an application which is automatically configured at deployment time. This means that you never need to store an application secret such as a storage account key in source control, or even e.g. as a secret variable in your build / deployment process.\nReturning the value of ARM Expressions as outputs. ARM Expressions can also be passed back as outputs and used further downstream once your deployment is complete:\nlet template = arm { location Location.WestEurope add_resource storageConfig // Mark the storage_key as an output in the ARM template.  output \u0026#34;storage_key\u0026#34; storageConfig.Key } // Deploy the template. let outputs = template |\u0026gt; Deploy.execute template [] // Get the value of the storage_key. let key = outputs.[\u0026#34;storage_key\u0026#34;] Be aware though, that the value of the storage_key is visible as a plain text value in the output - so anyone with access to, for example, the Azure portal will be able to see the values of the storage key if they look at the deployment history.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/parameters/","title":"Parameters and Variables","tags":[],"description":"","content":"ARM templates support the idea both of parameterisation of templates and of the use of variables within a template for e.g. placeholders and re-using values.\nFarmer, by design, has only limited support for parameters and no support for variables.

ARM templates also allow the use of a custom set of a commands which are embedded within strings to generate program logic, using expressions which contain template functions. For example, to concatenate a string inside a ARM template made up of two variables and put into a third variable, you might use something like the following:\n{ \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;second\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;World\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;serverName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[concat(variables(\u0026#39;first\u0026#39;), \u0026#39; \u0026#39;, variables(\u0026#39;second\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;!\u0026#39;)]\u0026#34; } } In F#, you have access to the full power of .NET, rather than a limited set of weakly-typed functions:\nlet first = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; let second = \u0026#34;World\u0026#34; let serverName = first + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + second + \u0026#34;!\u0026#34; let dbName = $\u0026#34;{first} {second}!\u0026#34; let db = sql { server_name serverName db_name dbName admin_username \u0026#34;mradmin\u0026#34; } Rapidly creating multiple resources You can also use F# list comprehensions to rapidly create several resources of the same type:\n// Create five SQL servers and databases let myDatabases = [ for i in 1 .. 5 -\u0026gt; sql { server_name $\u0026#34;server{i}\u0026#34; db_name $\u0026#34;database{i}\u0026#34; admin_username \u0026#34;mradmin\u0026#34; } ] // Add all five databases to the deployment let deployment = arm { location Location.NorthEurope add_resources myDatabases } "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/quickstarts/quickstart-2/","title":"Working with multiple resources","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Introduction In this quickstart, you\u0026rsquo;ll expand on the deployment authored in the previous quickstart as follows:\n add an Azure storage account add an application setting to the web app that references the storage account\u0026rsquo;s key set a dependency between the two resources  Creating a storage account Create a storage account by using the storageAccount builder.\nlet myStorage = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;yourfirststorage\u0026#34; }  Azure Storage Account names must be globally unique and between 3-24 alphanumeric lower-case characters!\n Referencing the storage account in the web app In this section, we will add an app setting to the web app and set the value to the storage account\u0026rsquo;s connection string.\n In F#, you need to define a value before you reference it, so make sure that you define the storage account above the web app.\n Add the storage account\u0026rsquo;s connection key to the webapp as an app setting.\nlet myWebApp = webApp { ... setting \u0026#34;storageKey\u0026#34; myStorage.Key } If you\u0026rsquo;re coming from a raw ARM template background, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the need to set dependencies between the Storage Account and Web App - Farmer will automatically do this for you!\n Settings can be strings or (as in this case) an ARM expression, which is evaluated at deployment time.\n Adding the storage account to the deployment Add the storage account to the deployment using the same add_resource keyword as you did with myWebApp.\nAnalysing the ARM template Run the application:\ndotnet run You should notice that the template now contains a storage account.

The IArmResource","tags":[],"description":"","content":"In this exercise, we\u0026rsquo;ll migrate our code from the previous step directly into the Farmer codebase.\nStep 2.1: Migrating to IArmResource Now that you know that your resource model produces the correct Json value when passed into Farmer, we can now create a proper type that contains the \u0026ldquo;parameterised\u0026rdquo; parts of the above function, such as name, sku and adminUserEnabled, and properly takes part in the Farmer pipeline, by implementing the IArmResource interface. This type is normally a full Record and should use types as required to capture e.g. SKUs or other elements that would benefit from typing (in the example above, sku is a string, but we will shortly replace that with a union type).\n// src/Farmer/Arm/ContainerRegistry.fs [\u0026lt;AutoOpen\u0026gt;] module Farmer.Arm.ContainerRegistry open Farmer // Create a reference to the full ARM registries type and version. let registries = ResourceType (\u0026#34;Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2019-05-01\u0026#34;) // Temporarily define the SKU and other types alongside the IArmResource. type Sku = | Basic | Standard | Premium type Registries = { Name : ResourceName Location : Location Sku : Sku AdminUserEnabled : bool } interface IArmResource with member this.ResourceId = registries.resourceId this.Name member this.JsonModel = {| name = this.Name.Value ``type`` = \u0026#34;Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries\u0026#34; apiVersion = \u0026#34;2019-05-01\u0026#34; sku = {| name = this.Sku.ToString() |} location = this.Location.ArmValue tags = {||} properties = {| adminUserEnabled = this.AdminUserEnabled |} |} :\u0026gt; _ // upcast to obj Notice how we perform simple \u0026ldquo;serialization\u0026rdquo; of elements such as the SKU, but otherwise most fields are just copied across.\nThe biggest difference is that we have now also introduced the notion of ResourceType and ResourceId. A ResourceType allows you to specify the versioned ARM type that your resource implements; a ResourceId represents the qualified path to a specific, named resource. It contains at least the resource\u0026rsquo;s type and its name, but can also optionally include e.g. the resource group that the resource belongs to.\nStep 2.2: Generating the ARM values more quickly Because most ARM resources have a set of fields that are commonly used e.g. name, location etc., Farmer comes with a helper factory function to construct ARM JSON objects quickly and easily. Here\u0026rsquo;s a shortened version of JsonModel above:\n{| registries.Create(this.Name, this.Location) with sku = {| name = this.Sku.ToString() |} properties = {| adminUserEnabled = this.AdminUserEnabled |} |} :\u0026gt; _ // upcast to obj Now, the common fields will be generated for us through the registies.Create function; any custom fields (such as sku and properties) are then applied on top.\nStep 2.3: Move domain types out of the IArmBuilder.  You can skip this step if you\u0026rsquo;re just experimenting in e.g. a script.\n For now, we\u0026rsquo;ve created any associated types such as Sku directly above the file, but you\u0026rsquo;ll want to migrate these to a Farmer.ContainerRegistry module in Common.fs afterwards e.g.\n// src/Farmer/Common.fs namespace Farmer module ContainerRegistry = type Sku = | Basic | Standard | Premium Step 2.4: Test out the new Registries record in Farmer. You can test this again easily by passing an instance into a Farmer deployment like we did in the previous step:\nopen Farmer.Arm.ContainerRegistry let registries = { Name = ResourceName \u0026#34;my-registry\u0026#34; Location = Location.WestEurope Sku = ContainerRegistry.Basic AdminUserEnabled = true } let deployment = arm { location Location.NorthEurope add_resource registries } deployment |\u0026gt; Writer.quickWrite \u0026#34;output\u0026#34;  Note that F# records must be completely filled at creation, so you must provide values for all four fields.\n You could now write a test to assert the Json structure. Most tests in the project though tend to test from the Farmer builders, which we will get to soon. You can stop right here if you want - what you\u0026rsquo;ve done so far allows you to create IArmResource objects which can be added to the Farmer pipeline. However, we will go further in the next exericse and make it even easier to create Container Registries by creating an IBuilder.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/basic-types/","title":"Basic Types","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Farmer often uses references to link resouces, when this is not possible, Farmer uses certain types to define links.\nResourceName A ResourceName represents a name of an ARM resource.\nResourceName \u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34; ResourceId A ResourceId identifies an ARM resource.\nThis is used when you want to link unmanaged resources to a deployment or have multiple deployment parts.\nA ResourceId can be created with the resourceId member of a ResourceType:\nlet subnet = Arm.Network.virtualNetworks.resourceId(ResourceName \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) or directly as a ResourceId:\nlet mySubnet = { Type = Arm.Network.subnets Name = ResourceName \u0026#34;my-vnet\u0026#34; ResourceGroup = Some(\u0026#34;myResourceGroup\u0026#34;) Subscription = None Segments = [ResourceName \u0026#34;mySubnet\u0026#34;] } These resource can be used i.e. in referencing a web app { } to a subnet.\nlet webApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;myWebApp\u0026#34; service_plan_name \u0026#34;myServicePlan\u0026#34; sku WebApp.Sku.B1 link_to_unmanaged_vnet mySubnet } "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/container-apps/","title":"Container Apps","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overview The Container Apps builder is used to create Azure Container Apps.\n Container Environment (Microsoft.Web/kubeEnvironments) Container App (Microsoft.Web/containerApps)  Turn on Resource Provider Before you deploy your container app, you need to turn on the Container Apps resource provider in your Azure subscription.\nGet sure you have the following providers registered: Microsoft.Kubernetes and Microsoft.ContainerService.\nContainer Environment Builder The Container Environment builder (containerEnvironment) defines settings for the Kubernetes envirionment that hosts the container apps.\n   Keyword Purpose     name Sets the name of the container environment.   app_insights_instance Specifies an App Insights instance.

Dependencies guarantee that when resources are created, Azure will provision them in the correct order so that e.g. a storage account is created before Azure tries to grab the storage account key / connection string for your web app setting.\nMuch of this work is done for you:\n Farmer creates multiple resources for you at the builder level, and will ensure that the appropriate dependencies are set for you - for example, when creating a SQL Azure instance, Farmer will automatically ensure that the database depends on the server. Farmer will generally identify dependencies correctly when you have a relationship between builders, such as setting the key of a storage account on a web app.  Automatic dependency detection In the sample below, the web app { } will automatically realise that it needs to depend on Storage Account based on the \u0026ldquo;owner\u0026rdquo; of Key expression that is supplied.\nlet myStorage = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;sampleaccount\u0026#34; } let myApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;storage_key\u0026#34; myStorage.Key } Manually setting dependencies Normally, Farmer will do everything you need. However, there are some times when you may need to explicitly set a dependency:\n Farmer has not automatically detected the dependencies (please raise an issue if you notice this!). You\u0026rsquo;re setting a dependency on a resource that you\u0026rsquo;re creating yourself, outside of Farmer. You want to set a dependency even though there is no explicit coupling between two resources / builders.  Setting a dependency requires you to call the depends_on keyword on the target resource, providing a handle to the dependent resource.\nlet myStorage1 = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;sampleaccountFirst\u0026#34; } let myApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34; depends_on myStorage1 } Here, we set up an explicit dependency on myApp for myStorage.\nAdding multiple dependencies at once You can also supply multiple dependencies at once as a list; this is useful if you are programmatically creating multiple resources.\n// Create five storage accounts let storageAccounts : IBuilder list = [ for letter in [ \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; .. \u0026#39;e\u0026#39; ] do storageAccount { name $\u0026#34;mystorage{letter}\u0026#34; } ] let myApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34; depends_on storageAccounts // add them all to the web app as dependencies } Notice the extra type hint, : IBuilder list. This is required because F# does not, by default, allow you to implicitly treat a list of values as a supertype. In this case, a StorageAccountConfig list is not considered implicitly convertable to : IBuilder list (which is an interface that StorageAccountConfig implements). Therefore, we have to do it ourselves using the extra type declaration.\nYou can also use the :\u0026gt; (safe upcast) operator when declaring the StorageAccount:\nlet storageAccounts = [ // inferred as IBuilder list  for letter in [ \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; .. \u0026#39;e\u0026#39; ] do storageAccount { name $\u0026#34;mystorage%c\u0026#34; letter) } :\u0026gt; IBuilder ]  We\u0026rsquo;re looking at improving this situation in the future using F#\u0026lsquo;s \u0026ldquo;flexible types\u0026rdquo; feature.\n All builders that support dependencies support a number of depends_on overloads:\n A single, or a list of, Builders (as shown above) A single, or a list of, resources by their Name A single, or a list of, IArmResources  "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/outputs/","title":"Outputs","tags":[],"description":"","content":"ARM templates also support the notion of outputs.

Type safety: Where possible, use F#\u0026lsquo;s type system to make it impossible to create invalid templates. Flexibility: Provide users with the ability to override the defaults where needed.  Farmer Resources Farmer works on a simple, consistent process:\n You create Farmer resources, such as Storage Accounts and Web Apps. Each Farmer resource can represent one or many ARM resources. For example, a Farmer webApp resource represents both the Microsoft.Web/sites and Microsoft.Web/serverfarms resources. In addition, it optionally also provides simplified access to an Microsoft.Insights/components. You configure each resource using simple, human-readable custom keywords in a strongly-typed environment. You link together resources as required. Once you have created all resources, you bundle them up together into an ARM deployment resource. You then generate (and optionally deploy) an ARM template. The rest of your deployment pipeline stays the same.  The diagram below illustrates how Farmer resources map to ARM ones:\ngraph TD subgraph ARM Template classDef danger fill:orange; C(Microsoft.Web/serverfarms) -. dependency .-F D(Microsoft.Insights/components) -. dependency .-F E(Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts) -. dependency .-F E -. storage key .- F E -. storage key .- G F(Microsoft.Web/sites) G(blobServices/containers) class C danger class D danger class E danger class F danger class G danger end subgraph Farmer A(webApp)-. depends on .-B B(storageAccount)-. key .-A end  In this example, we create a storage account and web app in Farmer, which maps five different ARM template resources. As you can see, resources in Farmer are declared at a higher level of abstraction than ARM template resources. This makes things much simpler to reason about, and quicker to author.\nAn example Farmer Resource All Farmer resources follow the same approach:\n You define a resource using a special \u0026ldquo;builder\u0026rdquo; that allows the use of custom keywords. This is known as an F# computation expression. Each builder is designed for a specific type of Azure resource e.g. websites, functions, virtual machines etc., and each has defaults set for the most common scenario. This resource is validated and converted into a Farmer configuration object, which contains the configuration for that resource including any defaults. This configuration is then added to an overarching Farmer ARM deployment object. The ARM deployment object is converted into an ARM template json file.  graph LR subgraph JSON C(ARM Template) end subgraph .NET A(Farmer Builder)--validation and defaults --B B(Farmer Configuration) --emitted to -- C end  Here\u0026rsquo;s an example web application.\nlet myWebApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;mystorage\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;myKey\u0026#34; \u0026#34;aValue\u0026#34; sku Sku.B1 always_on app_insights_off worker_size WorkerSize.Medium number_of_workers 3 run_from_package }  The webApp { } builder defines the start and end of the definition of the web application. Within this builder, you use custom keywords to configure the web app, such as name and setting. Some keywords take arguments, but others e.g. always_on are simple declarative markers.   You can view details of all farmer resources in the resource guide.\n Putting it all together The diagram above can be shown in code as follows:\n/// An Azure Storage account with a container. let storage = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;astorageaccount\u0026#34; add_public_container \u0026#34;myContainer\u0026#34; } /// An Azure App Service with built-in App Insights. let app = webApp { name \u0026#34;awebapp\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;storageKey\u0026#34; storage.Key // pull in the storage key to an app setting  depends_on storage // state that this web app depends on the storage account } /// An ARM deployment with both of the above resources attached let deployment = arm { location Location.NorthEurope add_resource storage add_resource app } // Write the ARM template out to myTemplate.json let filename = deployment.Template |\u0026gt; Writer.toJson |\u0026gt; Writer.toFile \u0026#34;myTemplate\u0026#34; "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/cosmos-db/","title":"Cosmos DB","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overview The CosmosDb package containers two builders, used to create databases and containers.\n CosmosDB Account (Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts) CosmosDB SQL (Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases) CosmosDB MongoDB (Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/mongodbDatabases) CosmosDB SQL Container (Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers)   There is currently only support for document databases (the so-called \u0026ldquo;SQL API\u0026rdquo;), with support for Gremlin, Table and Cassandra data models planned.\n Cosmos DB Builder The CosmosDB builder abstracts the idea of account and database into one.

The IBuilder interface","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Sometimes, ARM resources are captured at a level of abstraction that is too low for us to reason about. In such cases, we may wish to use the IBuilder interface. An IBuilder is not only even easier to consume by users than the F# record we looked at in the previous exercise, but can create multiple IArmResource objects at once. This is especially useful for more complex resources that tend to come in groups of two or three together - for example, Server Farm and Web Apps, or Cosmos DB Accounts, Databases and Containers. An IBuilder encapsulates the logic needed to create and configure all the resources together.\n In this example, the Container Registry builder only creates a single resource.\n Step 3.1: The Configuration Record The first step is to create a simple configuration record that contains any data that is required to be captured by the user. Often, this may map nearly 1:1 with the IArmResource - normally the main difference will be that you do not need to provide the Location here, as Farmer will automatically provide that for you.\n// src/Farmer/Arm/ContainerRegistry.fs let registries = ResourceType (\u0026#34;Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2019-05-01\u0026#34;) // src/Farmer/Builders.ContainerRegistry.fs type ContainerRegistryConfig = { Name : ResourceName Sku : Sku AdminUserEnabled : bool } interface IBuilder with member this.ResourceId = registries.resourceId this.Name member this.BuildResources location = [ { Name = this.Name Location = location Sku = this.Sku AdminUserEnabled = this.AdminUserEnabled } ] The IBuilder interface has two members:\n ResourceId - a field that is the identifying path of the resource (including resource type, version, and name). It\u0026rsquo;s used by Farmer when setting dependencies between multiple resources and for emitting the appropriate JSON. If you builder has several ARM resources, it should return the \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; resource in the builder that others would depend upon. BuildResources - a function takes the location that the resources should be deployed to, and should return the list of IArmResource resources that must be created - this is normally a relatively simple mapping. For more complex builders e.g. one which represent multiple IArmResource objects, your BuildResources function will emit a list of IArmResources.

Providing Builder syntax","tags":[],"description":"","content":"If you want to get the nice json-like syntax for your configuration record, you need to implement a separate class which contains a set of methods that act on the Configuration Record that you created previously - one for each keyword that you want.\n If you need have not built your own computation expression before, here are some background resources for you:\n Office microsoft docs The \u0026ldquo;Computation Expressions\u0026rdquo; series Workshop   Step 4.1: Creating basic keywords We will not cover the inner details of creating a Computation Expression (CE) here. For now, just know that a CE is a basic class (yes, like a C# class) that is very similar to an immutable fluent API you might see in C#, except that in F# you can expose each fluent method as what looks like a new keyword.\nTo get started the only member you need to implement is the Yield method, which returns the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; value of your record (i.e. before any fluent methods or keywords have been called).\n// Builder.ContainerRegistry.fs type ContainerRegistryBuilder() = /// Required - creates default \u0026#34;starting\u0026#34; values  member _.Yield _ = { Name = ResourceName.Empty Sku = Basic AdminUserEnabled = false } [\u0026lt;CustomOperation \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;] /// Sets the name of the Azure Container Registry instance.  member _.Name (state:ContainerRegistryConfig, name) = { state with Name = ResourceName name } [\u0026lt;CustomOperation \u0026#34;sku\u0026#34;\u0026gt;] /// Sets the name of the SKU/Tier for the Container Registry instance.  member _.Sku (state:ContainerRegistryConfig, sku) = { state with Sku = sku } [\u0026lt;CustomOperation \u0026#34;enable_admin_user\u0026#34;\u0026gt;] /// Enables the admin user on the Azure Container Registry.  member _.EnableAdminUser (state:ContainerRegistryConfig) = { state with AdminUserEnabled = true } Each keyword has a similar set of steps required:\n Create a member which takes in at least one argument - the current state object, which represents your configuration record. The implementation should perform some update to the state and return back the newly-updated state. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about \u0026ldquo;where\u0026rdquo; the state goes - the F# CE will \u0026ldquo;thread\u0026rdquo; the state between calls for you. Decorate the method with the CustomOperation attribute; the string value passed to it will become the keyword. Use _ to separate words of the keyword e.g. enable_admin_user. Put a /// comment on the method for intellisense to guide users.  Now you can create members on the builder that appear as custom operators in your resource CE. In each member you build up the state of the resource configuration you created in the previous step.\nStep 4.2 Consuming builders Firstly, create a single static instance of the ContainerRegistryBuilder class that you just made:\nlet containerRegistry = ContainerRegistryBuilder() Now, you can create Container Registries anywhere using the keyword syntax:\n/// myRegistry is of type ContainerRegistryConfig let myRegistry = containerRegistry { name \u0026#34;my-registry\u0026#34; sku Basic enable_admin_user } Parameterless keywords You can create parameterless keywords by simply only taking in the state argument e.g. enable_admin_user above.\nKeywords with multiple arguments You can take in multiple arguments by simply putting a comma after each additional argument. They will be consumed by the user with spaces.\nOverloaded keywords You can provide multiple overloads for a keyword. However, each overload must take in the same number of arguments. Do not re-apply the CustomOperation attribute - simply provide multiple methods with the same name.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/dedicated-hosts/","title":"Dedicated Hosts","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overview The hostGroup and host builders create dedicated hosts in azure and their parent resource, a host group, to efficiently manage a physical host resource in Azure.

Full code available here\n   Note: Your web application can be a C# web application - it does not need to be written in F#!\n Creating the ASP.NET web application Create a brand new ASP.NET web application:\n Create a directory for your new application and enter it. Using the dotnet SDK, create a new application: dotnet new mvc. Notice that inside the project file (either csproj or fsproj), the Project SDK is already set to Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web. This is more-or-less required for hosting in Azure. Locally publish the application to a directory called deploy: dotnet publish -c Release -o deploy.   dotnet publish puts all built files and outputs into a single folder, and adds a web.config as required for e.g. Azure, as long as your Project SDK is set correctly.\n Create the Web App Create a new Farmer application which contains a web app.\nopen Farmer open Farmer.Builders let webapplication = webApp { name \u0026#34;\u0026lt;web app name goes here\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } Configure Web App to deploy your ASP.NET application let webapplication = webApp { ... zip_deploy @\u0026#34;\u0026lt;path_to_your_deploy_folder\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } That\u0026rsquo;s it!

Except for small pull requests, create an issue to discuss the feature. The last thing we want is for someone to spend hours of their time on a feature only for someone else to have started work on something similar, or for the admins of the project to reject it for whatever reason e.g. does not fit with the project etc. Creating an issue does not take long and will help save time for everyone.\n2. Create Documentation Every PR to Farmer must have some documentation with it. If you modify a resource and add a new keyword, it must be added to the appropriate docs page.\n3. Write Unit Tests Every PR to Farmer should have at least one test associated with it. If no tests are added, you can expect at least a request for one or explanation as to why one is not necessary.\n4. Write Release Notes Every PR to Farmer must include an entry to the RELEASE_NOTES.md file under the next release. Briefly explain the feature and ideally link to the PR number e.g.\n5.

Try out Farmer and see what you think.\n Create as many issues as you can for both bugs, discussions and features Create suggestions for features and the most important elements you would like to see added  I have an Azure subscription, but I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert. I like the look of this - how do I \u0026ldquo;use\u0026rdquo; it?  Create an ARM template using the Farmer sample app. Follow the steps here to deploy the generated template into Azure. Log any issues or ideas that you find here.  How do I get Farmer to work from a continuous deployment (CD) process?  Look at some of the alternative strategies outlined here. Read up on ARM deployment strategies e.g. Azure Devops have guides here.  The Farmer .NET Template also has support for creating a Azure Devops-ready application from scratch.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know F#. Would you consider writing a C# version of this? I\u0026rsquo;m afraid not. F# isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to learn (especially for simple DSLs such as this), and you can easily integrate F# applications as part of a dotnet solution, since F# is a first-class citizen of the dotnet core ecosystem. You can even create new resources in C# since the core abstractions of Farmer are two simple .NET interfaces.\nAre you trying to replace ARM templates? No, we\u0026rsquo;re not. Farmer generates ARM templates that can be used just as normal; Farmer can also be used simplify to make the process of getting started much simpler, or incorporated into your build pipeline as a way to avoid managing difficult-to-manage ARM templates and instead use them as the final part of your build / release pipeline.\nAre you trying to compete with Pulumi? No, we\u0026rsquo;re not. Farmer has (at least currently) a specific goal in mind, which is to lower the barrier to entry for creating and working with ARM templates. We\u0026rsquo;re not looking to create a cross-platform DSL to also support things like Terraform etc. or provide a stateful service store that Pulumi offers. Instead, Farmer is a simple way to continue to use ARM templates today but benefit from a more rapid authoring and maintenance process.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no support for variables or parameters! Farmer intentionally has limited support for ARM parameters and variables. Read here to find out the alternatives.\nCan I add resources that are not supported by Farmer? Yes. You can use some adapters that Farmer provides to generate resources using basic .NET objects, or even paste ARM template JSON directly into Farmer and have that embedded inside. See the following links from the Contributing section:\n Using raw JSON with Resource.ofJSON Using anonymous records or objects with Resource.ofObj Using the IArmResource interface.  The resource I need isn\u0026rsquo;t included! Create an issue on our github repository, ideally with a sample ARM template and a link to the official Microsoft documentation on the resource. We can\u0026rsquo;t promise we\u0026rsquo;ll look at it immediately, but raising the issue is an important first step to getting more resources supported.\nBut our organisation really needs that resource enhancement today! Drop us an email explaining what you need; we\u0026rsquo;re happy to discuss a commercial support arrangement to provide you with features that you need in a more timely fashion.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/iot-hub/","title":"IOT Hub","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overview The IOT Hub builder creates IOT Hub and linked Provision Services.\n IOT Hubs (Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs) Provisioning Services (Microsoft.Devices/provisioningServices)  Builder Keywords    Keyword Purpose     name Specifies the name of the IOT Hub   sku Sets the SKU of the IOT Hub   capacity Sets the name of the capacity for the IOT Hub instance   partition_count Sets the name of the SKU/Tier for the IOT Hub instance   retention_days Sets the name of the SKU/Tier for the IOT Hub instance   enable_device_provisioning Sets the name of the SKU/Tier for the IOT Hub instance    Configuration Members    Member Purpose     GetKey Returns an ARM expression to retrieve the IOT Hub key for a specific policy e.g IotHubOwner or RegistryReadWrite.

This can either be a \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; secret config created using the Secret Builder, a string literal value which represents the parameter name, or a string literal with a resource and an expression based on that resource e.g. a storage account and the Key member.   add_secrets Adds multiple secrets to the vault. This can either be \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; secret configs created using the Secret Builder, string literal values which represents the parameter name.   disable_public_network_access Disables public network access to the vault.   add_tag Adds a tag to the key vault.   add_tags Adds multiple tags to the key vault.    Key Vault Add Access Policy Builder (keyVaultAddPolicies) As applications grow, more components often need access to a key vault. The keyVaultAddPolicies builder is used to add new access policies to an existing key vault without the need to redeploy the full key vault, potentially changing existing access.\n   Keyword Purpose     key_vault Sets the resource Id or a builder for the existing key vault where the policies should be added.   add_access_policies A list of policies to add to the key vault.   tenant_id Used if granting access to users or service principals from another tenant.    Configuration Members    Member Purpose     VaultUri Gets the ARM expression path to the key vault\u0026rsquo;s URI.    Utilities  The KeyVault module comes with a set of utility functions to quickly create access policies if you do not wish to use the AccessPolicy builder, in the Farmer.KeyVault.AccessPolicy module which enable creating an access policy for a PrincipalId or an ObjectId which will have the GET Secret permission. In addition, the AccessPolicy module also contains helpers to search for users or groups in active directory (requires Azure CLI installed), as well as their Object IDs. These can be used to rapidly create Access Policies for specific users.

This is similar to a service principal except that there is no credential to manage and the authorization token is retrieved through a secure internal handshake between the resource and the identity service in Azure.\n User Assigned Identity (Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities)  Using a managed identity as opposed to e.g. connection strings brings several benefits:\n There is no client secret or certificate to configure and rotate because this is handled implicitly by Azure infrastructure. The identity is tied to one or more specific resources, so cannot be used by anything else, like a user. Many services allow more granular permissions than e.g. a connection string. You can grant and revoke access completely independently of the application attempting to gain access to the resource.  Once created, the managed identity resource can be referenced by other resources both in order to:\n Enable a resource to run as that identity Enable a resource to grant permissions to that identity  For example, you may wish to run a Virtual Machine or an Web App under a identity that you create, and then to grant permissions to that identity to allow reading from a storage account. You can define the permissions completely independently of the Virtual Machine or Web App.\ngraph LR A(identity) B(virtual machine)-. runs as .-A D(web app)-. runs as .-A C(storage account)-. grants permissions .-A A -. request made in this identiy .-C   See here and here for the official documentation on the Microsoft Azure docs website.\n Identity Types in Azure Identities come in two flavours in Azure: System and User assigned.\n System Identities are available whenever you create a resource, such as a VM. Each resource has its own system identity, and they cannot be shared across resources. User Identities are created by you; they exist idependently of any resources and thus can be shared across them. In Farmer, the userAssignedIdentity builder can be used for this. You also need to \u0026ldquo;link\u0026rdquo; a user identity to the resource that you wish to be able to \u0026ldquo;run as\u0026rdquo; it.   User Assigned Identities are themselves ARM resources and need to be added to your Farmer arm {} blocks!\n graph LR A(user assigned identity) subgraph Web App B(system identity) end C(storage account) C -.grants permissions .- A C -.grants permissions .- B  User Assigned Identity Builder The userAssignedIdentity builder constructs user assigned managed identities which can be created and then assigned to one or more resources.\n   Keyword Purpose     name Sets the name of the user assigned identity.   add_tag Adds a tag to the user assigned identity resource.   add_tags Adds multiple tags to the user assigned identity resource.    Helper Methods Because the User Assigned Identity builder is so simple, we also provide a simple builder function to create identities as an alternative to using the standard builder syntax:\nopen Farmer.Builders let uai = createUserAssignedIdentity \u0026#34;mytestidentity\u0026#34; Example: System Identity In this example, a web app needs a secret from a key vault. By using the system identity on the web app, application code can be granted access to the key vault with no need to provide it a client secret.\nopen Farmer open Farmer.Builders let wa = webApp { name \u0026#34;myApp\u0026#34; system_identity // turn on the system identity of the web app } let vault = keyVault { name \u0026#34;my-vault\u0026#34; add_access_policies [ // grant access to the web app\u0026#39;s system identity to key vault.  // by default GET and LIST permissions are granted.  AccessPolicy.create wa.SystemIdentity ] } let template = arm { add_resources [ wa; vault ] } There is no need to add a specific identity resource to Farmer in this case because the System Identity is created along with the web app itself.\nExample: User Assigned Identity In this example, a web app needs access to a Storage Account with a specific role. By assigning an identity to the web app, the application code can be granted access to the storage account; we also provide the Client Id to the application as a public setting in order for the application to correctly impersonate as the identity within code.\nBy creating a user assigned identity, unlike a system identity, we can also apply this identity onto other resources so that they, too, can \u0026ldquo;share\u0026rdquo; the permissions and identity. In this example, we also apply the identity onto a container group.\n// Create a user assigned identity let sharedIdentity = userAssignedIdentity { name \u0026#34;container-group-identity\u0026#34; } // Apply it onto the web app let myWeb = webApp { name \u0026#34;myApp\u0026#34; // Add the identity to the web app  add_identity sharedIdentity // Provide the client id to the app for use in code  setting \u0026#34;ClientId\u0026#34; sharedIdentity.ClientId } let group = containerGroup { name \u0026#34;myapp-with-identity\u0026#34; add_instances [ containerInstance { name \u0026#34;my-app\u0026#34; image \u0026#34;myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:latest\u0026#34; } ] // Also apply it here.

For instance, you may want to have a web application with a database, so you\u0026rsquo;ll define your goal state that includes database and web application resources. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not always that simple - there are various reasons that some of the steps of a deployment cannot be represented by the goal state resource model.\n Creating a backup of a database before a deployment. Interacting with API\u0026rsquo;s that aren\u0026rsquo;t represented in ARM itself (Kubernetes control plane, networking devices, or the API\u0026rsquo;s of the application you\u0026rsquo;re deploying). Performing ARM operations such as creating a certificate.  In any of these scenarios, there is some imperative logic that needs to be included in the ARM deployment. To keep the ARM deployment itself repeatable, it\u0026rsquo;s often best to ensure this imperative logic is idempotent - that is, it can run repeatedly without incurring side effects.\nIn this tutorial, we will handle the third case, running an ARM operation to create a certificate in a key vault. We\u0026rsquo;ll create a deploymentScript resource for this, which creates a temporary ARM resource for the purposes of executing this imperative logic.\n Create a user assigned identity. Create a storage account for making the certificate available to the web app. Create a key vault for generating the certificate. Run an imperative script to create a certificate in the key vault and copy it to the storage account. Create a web application in a container group that attaches to the storage account to uses the certificate.    Full code available here\n  Create a user assigned identity A deployment script runs in a temporary container group and needs an identity, as does the container group. This identity will be a contributor over the resources in the resource group where this deployment runs so that it has permissions to upload the certificate to the storage account.\nlet appIdentity = userAssignedIdentity { name \u0026#34;my-app-user\u0026#34; } Create the Certificate Storage Account Depending on the type of compute resource used, you may be able to retrieve the certificate directly from the key vault on startup. However, for a container group, a good solution is to have a file share on a storage account. After creating the certificate, we will download it from the key vault and upload it to this storage account file share to make it available to the container group.\nlet certStorage = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;myappcertstorage123\u0026#34; sku Storage.Sku.Standard_LRS add_file_share \u0026#34;certs\u0026#34; } Create the Key Vault We need to create a key vault to generate the certificate. When a certificate is created in a key vault, the public key is stored as a certificate and the full certificate with private and public key is stored as a secret of the same name. To enable this access, we will need to define an accessPolicy on the key vault that allows our appIdentity to create and retrieve certificates and secrets.\nlet kv = keyVault { name \u0026#34;myappcertificates\u0026#34; add_access_policies [ accessPolicy { object_id appIdentity.PrincipalId secret_permissions [ KeyVault.Secret.Set; KeyVault.Secret.Get ] certificate_permissions [ KeyVault.Certificate.Create; KeyVault.Certificate.Get ] } ] } The Imperative Part: Creating the Certificate Creating a certificate is an imperative operation because this is a multiple step process where a key pair is created, then a certificate signing request is created from the key pair and signed by a certificate authority. Certificates can also be \u0026ldquo;self-signed\u0026rdquo;, meaning they have no certificate authority and must be individually trusted. This whole process means you cannot simply repeat it without side effects, so it is represented in ARM as an operation rather than a resource.\nCreating a certificate in an Azure key vault requires that you provide a policy for the certificate which defines the various settings such as the key size, issuer, and subject name (what identifies the host when presenting the certificate).\nYou can use the default policy directly, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t let you set the subject name, so instead, we will build our own policy. To get a reference on what a valid policy contains, use the following Azure CLI command to \u0026ldquo;scaffold\u0026rdquo; a policy:\naz keyvault certificate get-default-policy --scaffold\nWe want a policy.json that roughly matches this, with a few adjustments for our scenario. F# anonymous records are very handy for creating JSON directly, so we\u0026rsquo;ll use one here to create a policy JSON string similar to the scaffold. Because we need to embed this in our ARM template so it can run in the deployment script, we\u0026rsquo;ll convert it to base64 and avoid any issues with trying to embed JSON in another JSON file.\nlet policy = {| keyProperties = {| exportable = true keyType = \u0026#34;RSA\u0026#34; keySize = 2048 reuseKey = false |} secretProperties = {| contentType = \u0026#34;application/x-pkcs12\u0026#34; |} x509CertificateProperties = {| subject = \u0026#34;CN=my-web-app.eastus.azurecontainer.io\u0026#34; subjectAlternativeNames = {| dnsNames = [ \u0026#34;my-web-app.eastus.azurecontainer.io\u0026#34; ] |} |} issuerParameters = {| name = \u0026#34;Self\u0026#34; |} |} let policyJsonB64 = policy |\u0026gt; System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize // serialize to JSON  |\u0026gt; System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes // and then encode it for easy embedding  |\u0026gt; System.Convert.ToBase64String Now for the deployment script itself. This will run the Azure CLI within a temporary container. It needs to perform the following steps:\n Take the embedded base64 policy.json string and write it to the file system where the deployment script runs. Create a certificate, using that policy.json file. Download the secret containing the public and private key pair in a .pfx file. Upload the .pfx file to the storage account file share to make it available to the container group.  The string interpolation in F# 5.0 is very handy for embedding F# values in the bash script statements.\nlet script = [ \u0026#34;set -e\u0026#34; // Write the encoded policy to a file in the deployment script resource.  $\u0026#34;echo {policyJsonB64} | base64 -d \u0026gt; policy.json\u0026#34; // Run imperative az CLI commands to create the certificate.  $\u0026#34;az keyvault certificate create --vault-name {kv.Name.Value} -n my-app-cert -p @policy.json\u0026#34; // Download the cert  $\u0026#34;az keyvault certificate download --file cert.pem --vault-name {kv.Name.Value} -n my-app-cert\u0026#34; // Download the pfx with cert and private key  $\u0026#34;az keyvault secret show --vault-name {kv.Name.Value} -n my-app-cert | jq .value -r | base64 -d \u0026gt; key.pfx\u0026#34; // Upload to storage file  $\u0026#34;az storage file upload --account-name {certStorage.Name.ResourceName.Value} --share-name certs --source key.pfx\u0026#34; ] |\u0026gt; String.concat \u0026#34;;\\n\u0026#34; With the hard part out of the way, we can define the deploymentScript resource, which is a temporary ARM resource that represents running these imperative steps. Because we don\u0026rsquo;t want this to run until the key vault and storage account are available, we need to use depends_on and reference these two resources. Also, notice this uses the appIdentity that was granted access to the key vault secrets and certificates.\ndeploymentScript { name \u0026#34;create-certificate\u0026#34; identity appIdentity depends_on kv depends_on certStorage force_update cleanup_on_success retention_interval 1\u0026lt;Hours\u0026gt; script_content script } Creating the Web Application Our web application will be a simple \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; service, as the interesting part is that it listens on HTTPS. Doing this requires the key pair be loaded by the service when it creates the binding to an HTTPS port. Here is the script content. Notice we need to add the certificate to the X509Store. This avoids some SSL warnings within the service itself due to using a self-signed certificate. If you are using a trusted third party CA, this may not be necessary.\n#r \u0026#34;nuget: Suave, Version=2.6.0\u0026#34; open Suave open System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates let certWithKey = new X509Certificate2(\u0026#34;/certs/key.pfx\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) let store = new X509Store(StoreName.Root, StoreLocation.CurrentUser) store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadWrite) store.Add(certWithKey) store.Close() let config = { defaultConfig with bindings = [ HttpBinding.createSimple (HTTPS certWithKey) \u0026#34;0.0.0.0\u0026#34; 443 ] } startWebServer config (Successful.OK \u0026#34;Hello Secure Farmers!\u0026#34;) We will read this short script into a string that we can pass to our container group. In real life, you probably have a full application published in a container image, but for illustrative purposes, we are just embedding the script.\nlet webAppMain = System.IO.File.ReadAllText \u0026#34;keyvault-certs-app.fsx\u0026#34; Now we create the container group. It uses a .NET 5.0 SDK image to run the script and has two volume mounts. One is for the embedded script itself, and the other is for the volume mount from the Azure storage account file share where the certificate itself is stored.\nlet webApp = containerGroup { name \u0026#34;my-web-app\u0026#34; add_identity appIdentity add_instances [ containerInstance { name \u0026#34;fsi\u0026#34; image \u0026#34;mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0\u0026#34; command_line (\u0026#34;dotnet fsi /src/main.fsx\u0026#34;.Split null |\u0026gt; List.ofArray) add_volume_mount \u0026#34;script-source\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/src\u0026#34; add_volume_mount \u0026#34;cert-volume\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/certs\u0026#34; add_public_ports [ 443us ] cpu_cores 0.2 memory 0.5\u0026lt;Gb\u0026gt; } ] public_dns \u0026#34;my-web-app\u0026#34; [ TCP, 443us ] add_volumes [ volume_mount.secret_string \u0026#34;script-source\u0026#34; \u0026#34;main.fsx\u0026#34; webAppMain volume_mount.azureFile \u0026#34;cert-volume\u0026#34; \u0026#34;certs\u0026#34; certStorage.Name.ResourceName.Value ] } The ARM Template With all of these resources, we can create an ARM template. It contains four declarative resources: the user assigned identity, a key vault, a storage account, and a container group. It also contains a deployment script resource for the imperative logic.\narm { location Location.EastUS add_resources [ appIdentity kv certStorage createCertificate webApp ] } |\u0026gt; Writer.quickWrite \u0026#34;keyvault-certs\u0026#34; Deploying the resulting template through ARM will result in ARM attempting to reach the goal state with as much concurrency as dependencies allow. It will deploy the user assigned identity first, then both the key vault and the storage account at the same time, and then finally it will run the deployment script and deploy the container group.\nThe end result is a container group running an HTTPS service using a certificate that was created in the newly provisioned key vault.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/tutorials/minecraft-server-aci/","title":"Create your own Minecraft Server","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Introduction In this tutorial, you\u0026rsquo;ll use dotnet framework features and F# language techniques when building a template to create a fully functional Minecraft Server running on an Azure Container Instance with its world data stored in an Azure Storage Account.

Create a storage account for the world data. Define a deployment script that will download the Minecraft Server .jar file and upload it to the storage account, along with the configuration files. Create a container group for running the service;.  A few dependencies We will need a few dependencies here, so first let\u0026rsquo;s reference the packages and open the namespaces:\n Farmer - for building that Azure resources and deployment template.

There are four critical files for a server:\n ops.json - this includes the list of operators that can manage the server. whitelist.json - this includes a list of gamers who are allowed to use the server. eula.txt - this indicates that you\u0026rsquo;ve accepted the End User License Agreement for running a Minecraft Server, and you should read this since downloading and using the game implies you agree with it. server.properties - the server is a Java application, and this is the configuration for the application itself.  First we build a list of users that we will allow on our server. We\u0026rsquo;ll use this list to build both the ops.json (operators) and whitelist.json (allowed gamers), so we will indicate which ones are operators.\nlet operator = true /// Our list of minecraft users - their username, uuid, and whether or not they are an operator. let minecrafters = [ \u0026#34;McUser1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;a6a66bfb-6ff7-46e3-981e-518e6a3f0e71\u0026#34;, operator \u0026#34;McUser2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;d3f2e456-d6a4-47ac-a7f0-41a4dc8ed156\u0026#34;, not operator \u0026#34;McUser3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ceb50330-681a-4d9d-8e84-f76133d0fd28\u0026#34;, not operator ] Now we build the whitelist.json and ops.json files - the MinecraftConfig application handles formatting the configuration file, we just need to map from our list of minecrafters to the lists of the records for the whitelist and the operator. whitelist holds the contents of our whitelist.json file, and ops hosts the contents of the ops.json file. We will write use those later.\n/// Let\u0026#39;s allow our list of minecrafters on the whitelist. let whitelist = minecrafters |\u0026gt; List.map (fun (name, uuid, _) -\u0026gt; { Name=name; Uuid=uuid }) |\u0026gt; Whitelist.format /// Filter the minecrafters that aren\u0026#39;t operators. let ops = minecrafters |\u0026gt; List.filter (fun (_, _, op) -\u0026gt; op) // Filter anyone that isn\u0026#39;t an operator  |\u0026gt; List.map (fun (name, uuid, _) -\u0026gt; { Name=name; Level=OperatorLevel.Level4; Uuid=uuid }) |\u0026gt; Ops.format And we can generate an accepted EULA, storing this content in eula.\n/// And accept the EULA. let eula = Eula.format true Now we need a few properties that are used both for the server.properties and for the resulting infrastructure. The worldName tells Minecraft where to store the world data. Since this will be mounted to an Azure Storage File share, we create a binding for it to make sure the name we use in the server.properties file matches what we use in the storage account.\nSame for the serverPort, which is both used in the server.properties file and must be exposed publicly on the Azure Container Group.\nThe name of the storage account is used in three places: the storage account itself, in the deployment script that will upload files to the storage account, and in the container group that will mount a volume from it. The storageAccountName can be referenced in all three uses.\n/// Add bindings for fields that are referenced in a few places /// Name of the share for the world. let worldName = \u0026#34;world1\u0026#34; /// Port for this world let serverPort = 25565 /// Storage account name let storageAccountName = \u0026#34;mcworlddata\u0026#34; And now we create the server.properties file, storing it in serverProperties. With that, we completed generating all of the configuration files for the server and can move on to defining and deploying the infrastructure.\n/// Write the customized server properties. let serverProperties = [ ServerPort serverPort RconPort (serverPort + 10) EnforceWhitelist true WhiteList true Motd \u0026#34;Azure Minecraft Server\u0026#34; LevelName worldName Gamemode \u0026#34;survival\u0026#34; ] |\u0026gt; ServerProperties.format Creating the Storage Account A Minecraft server stores some data for the world that is generated and people play in. That data, along with the configuration files, is stored in a directory that must be accessible to the server. Azure Container Groups are able to attach an Azure Storage Account File share as a volume, so we will create a storage account with a file share.\n/// A storage account, with a file share for the server config and world data. let serverStorage = storageAccount { name storageAccountName sku Storage.Sku.Standard_LRS add_file_share_with_quota worldName 5\u0026lt;Gb\u0026gt; } Defining the Deployment Script There are some deployment orchestration tasks that cannot be fully represented by Azure resources, but we need ARM to carry them out for us. We can use deploymentScripts as an Azure resource to represent script execution. This allows us to specify orchestration properties, such as that ARM should execute this deployment script after the storage account is deployed.\nThe script itself runs in a temporary container that has the Azure CLI ready and authenticated with a user that has the \u0026ldquo;Contributor\u0026rdquo; role over everything in this deployment. This is helpful because it means our script runs as a user that can access the storage account to upload content.\nWe need this deployment script to do three things:\n Copy the configuration files to the storage account. Download the current server.jar to the script container\u0026rsquo;s temporary storage. Upload the server.jar to the storage account.  Embedding Configuration Files First we will tackle the configuration files. We are going use F# to generate the CLI script, so we can actually embed these in the deployment script itself. To avoid any trouble with escaping characters for our script, we will encode all of the configuration files as base64 strings when we build the script and then the script will decode the base64 data and write files out to the container file system where the Azure CLI can upload them.\n Convert each configuration file to base64. Embed in shell script run by deployment. When the deployment script runs, it will decode and save as files. And then it will use az storage file upload to transfer them to the storage account.  /// A deployment script to create the config in the file share. let deployConfig = // Helper function to base64 encode the files for embedding them in the  // deployment script.  let b64 (s:string) = s |\u0026gt; System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes |\u0026gt; Convert.ToBase64String // Build a script that embeds the content of these files, writes to the  // deploymentScript instance and then copies  // to the storageAccount file share. We will include the contents of these  // files as base64 encoded strings so there is no need to worry about  // special characters in the embedded script.  let uploadConfig = [ whitelist, Whitelist.Filename ops, Ops.Filename eula, Eula.Filename serverProperties, ServerProperties.Filename ] |\u0026gt; List.map (fun (content, filename) -\u0026gt; $\u0026#34;echo {b64 content} | base64 -d \u0026gt; {filename} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; az storage file upload --account-name {storageAccountName} --share-name {worldName} --source {filename}\u0026#34;) That seemed a bit complicated, but using the best of both F# and the Azure CLI, the actual code to do this is minimal. The b64 function converts any string you give it to bytes and then base64 encodes those bytes into a string we can embed in the script.\nNext we have a list that contains the contents of each configuration file paired with the filename we need to write. We map each of those items to an interpolated string, which is where F# can execute little bits of code when building the string. Within the interpolated string, we call the b64 function to encode the contents of each file, which is what $\u0026quot;echo {b64 content}\u0026quot; does. When the script executes, it will pass that string into base64 -d which decides the base64 back into bytes that are written to a file. After each file is written, it\u0026rsquo;s uploaded with az storage file upload which again uses interpolated string values to get the storageAccountName, worldName, and filename values.\nDeploying the Server Software Having embedded the configuration files, now we need to add a line to the script to download the Minecraft server.jar and upload it as well. Whenever a new Minecraft Server is released, they update this page with a link that is named for the server version.\nWithout F#, we would probably stop here and just use the link for whatever version is out today. But F# has nice toys for reading and exploring data, like FSharp.Data which can parse HTML files, so we\u0026rsquo;re only a few lines away from scraping the download page for the link to the current version.\nWhen this F# code is executed to build the ARM template, it will load the Download page, find the link starting with minecraft_server, and copy the URL from the href on that link. We will embed that URL into our deployment script as a parameter to a curl call which will download the file before calling az storage file upload to copy the file to the storage account.\n/// The script will also need to download the server.jar and upload it.  let uploadServerJar = let results = HtmlDocument.Load \u0026#34;https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server\u0026#34; // Scrape for anchor tags from this download page.  results.Descendants [\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;] // where the inner text contains \u0026#34;minecraft_server\u0026#34; since that\u0026#39;s what is  // displayed on that link  |\u0026gt; Seq.filter (fun (x:HtmlNode) -\u0026gt; x.InnerText().StartsWith \u0026#34;minecraft_server\u0026#34;) // And choose the \u0026#34;href\u0026#34; attribute if present  |\u0026gt; Seq.choose(fun (x:HtmlNode) -\u0026gt; x.TryGetAttribute(\u0026#34;href\u0026#34;) |\u0026gt; Option.map(fun (a:HtmlAttribute) -\u0026gt; a.Value())) |\u0026gt; Seq.head // If it wasn\u0026#39;t found, we\u0026#39;ll get an error here.  |\u0026gt; (fun url -\u0026gt; $\u0026#34;curl -O {url} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; az storage file upload --account-name {storageAccountName} --share-name {worldName} --source server.jar\u0026#34;) Now we have two lists:\n uploadConfig is a list of the four lines of bash that will decode and then upload the configuration files to the storage account. uploadServerJar is a line of bash to download the server software and upload it to the storage account.  We concat those lines together with a semicolon ;  to break up our commands, and we have a full script we can run. The deploymentScript resource itself is fairly simple, and we use depends_on serverStorage to make sure this only runs after our storage account is deployed.\nlet scriptSource = uploadServerJar :: uploadConfig |\u0026gt; List.rev // do the server upload last so it won\u0026#39;t start until the configs are in place.  |\u0026gt; String.concat \u0026#34;; \u0026#34; deploymentScript { name \u0026#34;deployMinecraftConfig\u0026#34; // Depend on the storage account so this won\u0026#39;t run until it\u0026#39;s there.  depends_on serverStorage script_content scriptSource force_update } Creating the Container Instance The container instance runs a Java Runtime Environmennt, giving it enough CPU and memory for a small server with a few players. It has a volume mounted to the Azure Storage Account File share where the configuration files and server.jar are uploaded.\nThe containerGroup has a dependency on the storageAccount so it won\u0026rsquo;t be deployed until the storageAccount is deployed. There is a bit of a race condition since the container group could be deployed and start before the deploymentScript uploads the server.jar and configuration files. To prevent this issue the container runs a while loop in bash until the server starts successfully.\nlet serverContainer = containerGroup { name \u0026#34;minecraft-server\u0026#34; public_dns \u0026#34;azmcworld1\u0026#34; [ TCP, uint16 serverPort ] add_instances [ containerInstance { name \u0026#34;minecraftserver\u0026#34; image \u0026#34;mcr.microsoft.com/java/jre-headless:8-zulu-alpine\u0026#34; // The command line needs to change to the directory for the file share  // and then start the server.  // It needs a little more memory than the defaults, -Xmx3G gives it 3 GiB  // of memory.  command_line [ \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34; \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34; // We will need to do a retry loop since we can\u0026#39;t have a depends_on  // for the deploymentScript to finish.  $\u0026#34;cd /data/{worldName}; while true; do java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Xms1G -Xmx3G -jar server.jar nogui \u0026amp;\u0026amp; break; sleep 30; done\u0026#34; ] // If we chose a custom port in the settings, it should go here.  add_public_ports [ uint16 serverPort ] // It needs a couple cores or the world may lag with a few players  cpu_cores 2 // Give it enough memory for the JVM  memory 3.5\u0026lt;Gb\u0026gt; // Mount the path to the Azure Storage File share in the container  add_volume_mount worldName $\u0026#34;/data/{worldName}\u0026#34; } ] // Add the file share for the world data and server configuration.  add_volumes [ volume_mount.azureFile worldName worldName serverStorage.Name.ResourceName.Value ] } Here we will build the template. The deployConfig deployment script is especially interesting as it contains the embedded configuration files and the curl command with the link to the current server.jar from scraping the download page.\n/// Build the deployment with storage, deployment script, and container group. let deployment = arm { location Location.EastUS add_resources [ serverStorage deployConfig serverContainer ] } deployment |\u0026gt; Writer.quickWrite \u0026#34;minecraft-server\u0026#34; After running this deployment, view the container group in the Azure Portal or with az container logs to watch the server start up and generate a world. Once the world is generated, it\u0026rsquo;s ready to connect from your Minecraft Java Edition client by entering the DNS name for the container group!\nIf you need to change the configuration you could connect to the terminal of the container instance. But in the spirit of mature configuration management and immutable infrastructure, you should rebuild the config, stop the container group, and redeploy. The existing state - the minecraft world data - is left intact in the storage account and the configuration is replaced with your updates. Once the update is deployed, you can restart the container group.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/tutorials/aci-fsx/","title":"F# Script in a Container Group","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Introduction In this tutorial, you will deploy an F# script directly to an Azure Container Group. This is useful when you need to fill a gap in your solution with some quick application logic or to test scenarios on Azure before building a more complex application.

Create the F# Script Scripts are often useful for quick automation or very simple application logic. Our goal here is to create a small HTTP service - this could be used for a health check service or to bootstrap a larger application, but we\u0026rsquo;ll keep it very simple for illustrative purposes.

The container instances in the group can communicate with each other and share files over volume mounts.\nOur script relies on the dotnet 5 SDK to run the script with the dotnet fsi command, so we will run it on the dotnet/sdk:5.0 docker image which includes this SDK. Since our script creates a web listener on port 8080, we will add that as a public port and give it a DNS name so we can reach it.\nopen Farmer open Farmer.Builders let containers = containerGroup { name \u0026#34;my-app\u0026#34; add_instances [ containerInstance { name \u0026#34;fsi\u0026#34; image \u0026#34;mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0\u0026#34; add_public_ports [ 8080us ] } ] public_dns \u0026#34;my-fsi-app\u0026#34; [ TCP, 8080us ] } Include the script in the deployment The F# script will be embedded in the template as a secret_string. This creates a file in the container group that can be mounted into the file system on any of the container instances in the group. In our case, we will mount the F# script as a file named main.fsx in the container group and mount the directory containing that file as /src. With this in place we can also set the dotnet fsi command to run on container start, executing the script.\nlet containers = containerGroup { name \u0026#34;my-app\u0026#34; add_instances [ containerInstance { name \u0026#34;fsi\u0026#34; image \u0026#34;mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0\u0026#34; add_public_ports [ 8080us ] // Add a volume mount with the script source.  add_volume_mount \u0026#34;script-source\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/src\u0026#34; // Set the command line to run \u0026#39;dotnet fsi /src/main.fsx\u0026#39; on startup  command_line (\u0026#34;dotnet fsi /src/main.fsx\u0026#34;.Split null |\u0026gt; List.ofArray) } ] public_dns \u0026#34;my-fsi-app\u0026#34; [ TCP, 8080us ] // Read our script source when building the ARM template and embed it into the template as a secret string volume mount to attach to the container group.  add_volumes [ volume_mount.secret_string \u0026#34;script-source\u0026#34; \u0026#34;main.fsx\u0026#34; (System.IO.File.ReadAllText \u0026#34;main.fsx\u0026#34;) ] } The resulting template contains the contents of the F# script embedded as base64 so we have a standalone template that can be deployed to ARM.\narm { location Location.EastUS add_resources [ containers ] } When the container group starts, it will execute the F# script, starting the service. This is very useful for gathering source and configuration from your local or internal environment and including it in a deployment. We are able to use this technique due to two unique features:\n Farmer is an \u0026ldquo;embedded\u0026rdquo; DSL - rather than simply a friendly version of the ARM template language, it brings the full feature set of .NET when building a template. This makes reading a script from the file system, converting to base64, and embedding in the template a simple process. ARM templates are not executed locally like Azure CLI scripts - they are a specification for ARM to deploy the infrastructure on your behalf. Once the F# script on your local machine is embedded into the template, ARM is able to pass it to your infrastructure securely over Azure\u0026rsquo;s control plane.

This is a slightly more verbose option, but you may find it clearer, and as we\u0026rsquo;ll see shortly, it can sometimes be useful to declare these instances outside of the web app:\nlet plan = servicePlan { name \u0026#34;theFarm\u0026#34; sku WebApp.Sku.F1 } let ai = appInsights { name \u0026#34;insights\u0026#34; } let aWebApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;primarywebapp\u0026#34; link_to_service_plan plan link_to_app_insights ai } let anotherWebApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;secondarywebapp\u0026#34; link_to_service_plan plan link_to_app_insights ai }  As you are creating the plan and AI instances yourself, you also need to remember to add them to the arm { } block!\n Rapidly creating multiple web apps F# has excellent support for working with collections of data, including creating data.

Use of for .. in .. do syntax to iterate over numbers 1 to 4, assigning each value to i. Creating unique names for each web app using simple string concatentation. An explicit type annotation (: IBuilder list). Without getting into too much detail, this is needed because F# is somewhat stricter about implicit type conversions than other languages, particularly around list contra/covariance.  List comprehensions in F# are very powerful.

We\u0026rsquo;ll cover the following steps:\n Creating an Azure Functions instance, with automatically configured storage and app insights instances. Creating a SQL Azure database and server. Configuring the Functions instance to have connection settings required to connect to both Storage and SQL instances. Safely providing a SQL Server password to Farmer at deployment time.

Also, provide the connection string that is derived from the SQL instance that you just created.\nlet etlProcessor = functions { name \u0026#34;etlprocessor\u0026#34; storage_account_name \u0026#34;mydata\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;sql-conn\u0026#34; (transactionalDb.ConnectionString \u0026#34;parseddata\u0026#34;) }  Functions instances require a storage account to operate, and will automatically create one for you. In this sample, we have explicitly provided the storage account name; you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do this - Farmer will derive one based on the function instance name. If you prefer to manage the storage account yourself, you can create a storage account and use the link_to_storage_account keyword instead.\nFarmer will also automatically configure the functions instance with connection string settings for both the AzureWebJobsStorage and AzureWebJobsDashboard settings. You can use these to also configure your functions app to read from.\n Adding extra type safety for sharing resources If the mistype the database name for the connection string, Farmer will automatically fail and let you know at runtime. However, a better approach is to use F# to enforce sharing the same database name across the Function instance and SQL server by referencing the database instance directly, instead of a raw string:\nlet database = sqlDb { name \u0026#34;isaacparseddata\u0026#34; sku Sql.DtuSku.S1 } let transactionalDb = sqlServer { ... add_databases [ database ] } let etlProcessor = functions { ... setting \u0026#34;sql-conn\u0026#34; (transactionalDb.ConnectionString database) }  In this case, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add the database as a resource to the arm { } block; Farmer will do it automatically as part of the sqlServer builder.\n Add both resources to your ARM template let template = arm { location Location.WestEurope add_resource transactionalDb add_resource etlProcessor } Deploy the template When deploying the template, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide the password for the SQL Server instance.

A member on the sql configuration value can be used to quickly get to this and to set the password at deployment time:\ntemplate |\u0026gt; Deploy.execute \u0026#34;my-resource-group\u0026#34; [ transactionalDb.PasswordParameter, \u0026#34;SQL PASSWORD GOES HERE\u0026#34; ] |\u0026gt; printfn \u0026#34;%A\u0026#34;  You should never commit secrets into source control.

In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll store the key for a storage account in Keyvault, but it could be anything. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover the following steps:\n Creating a Web App, Storage Account and a KeyVault instance. Safely adding the Storage Account key into KeyVault. Granting a read-only trust between KeyVault and the Web App. Referencing the KeyVault setting from the Web App.    Full code available here\n  Create basic resources Start by creating the three main resources we need: a web app, storage account and key vault in the following ordwer:\nopen Farmer open Farmer.Builders let datastore = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;\u0026lt;storage name goes here\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } let webapplication = webApp { name \u0026#34;\u0026lt;web app name goes here\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } let secretsvault = keyVault { name \u0026#34;\u0026lt;key vault name goes here\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } Configure KeyVault with the Storage Key Let\u0026rsquo;s now add the storage account key to the key vault:\nlet secretsvault = keyVault { name \u0026#34;isaacsupersecret\u0026#34; add_secret (\u0026#34;storagekey\u0026#34;, datastore.Key) } Grant secret access to the web app Now we have KeyVault grant permission to the web app:\nlet webapplication = webApp { ... system_identity } let secretsvault = keyVault { ... add_access_policy (AccessPolicy.create webapplication.SystemIdentity) } The AccessPolicy.create builder method has several overloads; this one grants basic GET and LIST permissions to the web application\u0026rsquo;s built-in system identity, which we have just activated above. You can also supply other permissions as a secondary argument to the create method.\nConnect secret to the web app Now, we use Farmer\u0026rsquo;s Web App / Keyvault integration to seamlessly provide access to key vault secrets:\nlet webapplication = webApp { ... link_to_keyvault (ResourceName \u0026#34;\u0026lt;key vault name goes here\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) secret_setting \u0026#34;storagekey\u0026#34; } or\nlet kv = keyVault { name \u0026#34;keyvault\u0026#34; } let webapplication = webApp { ... link_to_keyvault kv secret_setting \u0026#34;storagekey\u0026#34; } The first keyword \u0026ldquo;links\u0026rdquo; the vault with the web app, and tells Farmer that all \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; settings should now be read from this vault. We cannot reference the keyvault directly in this case because it\u0026rsquo;s declared after the web application, so we construct a ResourceId reference ourselves.\nThe second keyword actually adds the secret to the web app. If you hadn\u0026rsquo;t added the link_to_keyvault keyword, this would be rendered into ARM as a secret parameter, but in this case because we\u0026rsquo;ve linked the vault in, it gets redirected to point there instead.\nAdding extra type safety for sharing resources To prevent accidentally mistyping the secret or vault names, you should bind the magic strings into symbols at the top of the template and replace usages in the template.\nlet secretName = \u0026#34;storagekey\u0026#34; let vaultName = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;key vault name goes here\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Add all resources to your ARM template Add all the resources into an arm builder and then deploy the template as normal.\nlet template = arm { location Location.WestEurope add_resources [ secretsvault datastore webapplication ] } That\u0026rsquo;s it! You now have a web application that can read the secret from the vault without using any keyvault connection string. If you log into the portal, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the secret setting is indeed in the Configuration section, but will have a green tick and a \u0026ldquo;Key vault reference\u0026rdquo; message next to it:\n  The value of the secret will look something like this:\n@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://\u0026lt;key vault name goes here\u0026gt;.vault.azure.net/secrets/storagekey) The App Service will transparently retrieve the secret from the vault for you when you try to access the setting.\n By default, even you will not be able to access the secret from key vault! If you want to grant yourself access to the secret in the vault, you can use the AccessPolicy.findUsers method in code to retrieve your principal and grant access to the secret through Farmer. Alternatively, you can manually grant yourself access through the Portal etc.\n "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/","title":"Farmer","tags":[],"description":"","content":"  Making repeatable Azure deployments easy! Farmer is an easy-to-learn library for rapidly authoring and deploying entire Azure architectures.\n Infrastructure-as-code, done right. Simple code snippets allow you to rapidly construct complex topologies. Idempotent deployments. Safely provision a template repeatedly and know that only changes will be applied. Cross-platform. Runs on .NET Core on Windows, Mac or Linux. Built on trusted technologies. Farmer uses Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure Resource Manager (ARM) technology for deployments to Azure. Commercial supported. Professional support plans for teams that wish to benefit from peace of mind and further improve the product. Easy to learn, easy to understand code through a simple, strongly-typed and pragmatic DSL.  Already using ARM templates? Farmer has you covered.\n Farmer is completely backwards compatible with ARM templates. Farmer generates standard ARM templates so you can continue to use existing deployment processes. Safely create dependencies between resources. Uses static typing to give confidence that your templates will work first time. Easily access common properties of resources. No more fighting to concatenate cryptic strings! Extensible API. Add new helpers and members as needed. Open source and free. Farmer is free to use and modify. We welcome contributions to the project!  Why not Azure Resource Manager? Azure Resource Manager is a service-side orchestrator, as such, Farmer does use ARM! It simply replaces the templating language with a statically-verifiable DSL to declare resources and comes with helper functions to perform common tasks. Farmer templates are around 5-8 times smaller than ARM templates, meaning they are quicker and easier to author, understand and maintain.
