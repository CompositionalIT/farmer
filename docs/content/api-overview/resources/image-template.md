#### Overview
The Image Template builder is used to create Image Templates for generating VM images. An image template starts with a source image, runs several customizations, and then can finally distribute the image to one or more destinations, including an Azure Image Gallery, a managed image, or a VHD file.

* Image Templates (`Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates`)
