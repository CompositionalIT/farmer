| Gateway | er_gateway_sku | SKU for an ExpressRoute gateway |
| Gateway | vpn_gateway_sku | SKU for a VPN gateway |
| Gateway | vpn_type | Sets the VPN type to route-based (default) or policy-based. |
| Gateway | gateway_ip_config | Specifies the gateway public and private IP addresses |
| Gateway | active_active_ip_config | Specifies the second public and private IP configuration for a redundant gateway |
| Gateway | disable_bgp | BGP is enabled by default, but this can disable it |
| Gateway | vpn_client | Specifies the VPN client configuration using the vpnclient builder (optional) |
| VPNClient | add_address_pool | The reference of the address space resource which represents Address space for P2S VpnClient |
| VPNClient | add_root_certificate | Adds the name and the public data of a root certificate to validate client certificates used for VPN Client connexion. This can be either just the data of the base64 content of the certificate or a multiline string starting with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and ending with -----END CERTIFICATE----- |

#### Example

```fsharp
open Farmer
open Farmer.Builders
open Farmer.VirtualNetworkGateway

let gw = gateway {
    name "er-gateway"
    vnet "my-vnet" // Must contain a subnet named 'GatewaySubnet'
    er_gateway_sku ErGatewaySku.Standard

    vpn_client
        (vpnclient {
           add_address_pool "10.31.0.0/16"
           add_root_certificate "rootcert" "" })
}


let privateNet = vnet {
    name "my-vnet"
    add_address_spaces [
        "10.30.0.0/16"
