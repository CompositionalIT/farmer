#### Overview
The Load Balancer builder (`loadBalancer`) creates load balancers that can distribute load amongst healthy services in a backend pool on public or private networks.

* Load balancers (`Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers`)
* Load balancer frontend IP configurations (`Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/frontendIPConfigurations`)
* Load balancer backend address pools (`Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/backendAddressPools`)
* Load balancer health probes (`Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/probes`)
