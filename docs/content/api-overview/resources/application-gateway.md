#### Overview
The Application Gateway builder is used to create Application Gateways.

* Application Gateways (`Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways`)

#### Application Gateway Builder Keywords
The Application Gateway builder (`appGateway`) constructs Application Gateways.

| Keyword | Purpose |
|-|-|
| name | Sets the name of the Application Gateway. |
| sku_capacity | Sets the capacity for this SKU of Application Gateway. |
| add_identity | Assigns a managed identity to the Application Gateway. |
| add_ip_configs | Assigns one or more gateway IP configuration for the subnet where it should be created. |
| add_frontends | Assigns one or more frontend IP configuration for a public or private IP for the services accessible through the gateway. |
| add_frontend_ports | Assigns one or more frontend ports to listen |
| add_http_listeners | Assigns one or more http listeners. |
| add_backend_address_pools | Assigns one or more backend pools. |
| add_backend_http_settings_collection | Assigns HTTP settings for the listener. |
| add_request_routing_rules | Assigns routing rules between frontend IP configurations and ports and services in the backend pool. |
| add_probes | Assigns health probes to ensure backend services are healthy or removed from the pool. |

#### Complete Example

This example creates an application gateway frontend with an NSG and a backend virtual network where application services would be running.
