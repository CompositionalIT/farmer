#### Example
```fsharp
open Farmer
open Farmer.Builders
open Farmer.ContainerGroup

let nginx = containerInstance {
    name "nginx"
    image "nginx:1.17.6-alpine"
    add_ports PublicPort [ 80us; 443us ]
    add_ports InternalPort [ 9090us; ]
    memory 0.5<Gb>
    cpu_cores 1
    env_vars [
        env_var "CONTENT_PATH" "/www"
        secure_env_var "SECRET_PASSWORD" "shhhhhh!"
    ]
    add_volume_mount "secret-files" "/config/secrets"
    add_volume_mount "source-code" "/src/farmer"
    probes [
        liveliness {
            http "http://localhost:80/"
            initial_delay_seconds 15
        }
    ]
}

let containerGroupUser = userAssignedIdentity {
    name "aciUser"
}

let group = containerGroup {
    name "webApp"
    operating_system Linux
    restart_policy AlwaysRestart
    add_identity containerGroupUser
    add_udp_port 123us
    add_instances [ nginx ]
    add_registry_credentials [
        registry "mygregistry.azurecr.io" "registryuser"
    ]
    add_volumes [
        volume_mount.secret_string "secret-files" "secret1" "abcdefg"
        volume_mount.git_repo "source-code" (Uri "https://github.com/CompositionalIT/farmer")
    ]
}
```

#### Private Virtual Network Example

Attaching a container group to a virtual network requires adding a service
delegation on a subnet indicating it is for container groups, adding a
network profile to bind the container group interface to that subnet, and
finally adding the container group itself with a private IP address.

```fsharp
open Farmer
open Farmer.Builders

let privateNetwork = vnet {
    name "private-vnet"
    add_address_spaces [
        "10.30.0.0/16"
    ]
    add_subnets [
        subnet {
            name "ContainerSubnet"
            prefix "10.30.19.0/24"
            add_delegations [
                SubnetDelegationService.ContainerGroups
            ]
        }
    ]
}

let aciProfile = networkProfile {
    name "vnet-aci-profile"
    vnet "private-vnet"
    subnet "ContainerSubnet"
}

let myContainer = container {
    name "helloworld"
    image "microsoft/aci-helloworld"
    add_ports PublicPort [ 80us ]
}

let group = containerGroup {
    name "webApp"
    operating_system Linux
    restart_policy AlwaysRestart
    add_instances [ myContainer ]
    network_profile "vnet-aci-profile"
    private_ip [TCP, 80us]
}
```

#### Execute container command example

Modified from azure-cli example here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-start-command

```fsharp
open Farmer
open Farmer.Builders
open Farmer.ContainerGroup

let wordcount = containerInstance {
    name "mycontainer1"
    image "mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-wordcount:latest"
    memory 0.5<Gb>
    cpu_cores 1
    env_vars [
        env_var "NumWords" "3"
        env_var "MinLength" "5"
    ]
    command_line [ "python"; "wordcount.py"; "http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/full.html" ]
}

let group = containerGroup {
    name "wordcount"
    operating_system Linux
    restart_policy RestartOnFailure
    add_instances [ wordcount ]
}
```
#### Using an initContainer on startup

An initContainer will run on container group startup before any of the containers are executed.

If there are any issues with the initContainer, it will remain in a 'Creating' state indefinitely. Check
for issues by viewing the logs for the init container(s):

`az container logs -g resource-group-name -n container-group-name --container-name init-container-name`

The example below creates a volume mount that is shared between the initContainer and the container
instances. It writes to a file so that the nginx container can serve that file once the group is running.

```fsharp
arm {
    location Location.WestEurope
    add_resources [
        containerGroup {
            name "container-group-with-init"
            operating_system Linux
            restart_policy ContainerGroup.AlwaysRestart
            add_volumes [
                volume_mount.empty_dir "html"
            ]
            add_init_containers [
                initContainer {
                    name "write-index-file"
                    image "debian"
                    add_volume_mount "html" "/usr/share/nginx/html"
                    command_line [
                        "/bin/sh"
                        "-c"
                        "mkdir -p /usr/share/nginx/html && echo 'hello there' >> /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html"
                    ]
                }
            ]
            add_instances [
                containerInstance {
                    name "nginx"
                    image "nginx:alpine"
                    add_volume_mount "html" "/usr/share/nginx/html"
                    add_public_ports [ 80us; 443us ]
                    memory 0.5<Gb>
                    cpu_cores 0.2
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
