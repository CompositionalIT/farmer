#### Overview
The Functions builder is used to create Azure Functions accounts. It abstracts the App Host and Service Plan into the same component, and will also create and configure a linked App Insights resource. In addition, it will automatically create a backing storage account required by the functions runtime.

* Web Site (`Microsoft.Web/sites`)
* Web Host (`Microsoft.Web/serverfarms`)
* Application Insights (`Microsoft.Insights/components`)
* Storage Accounts (`Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`)

#### Builder Keywords

| Keyword | Purpose |
|-|-|
| name | Sets the name of the functions instance. |
| service_plan_name | Sets the name of the service plan hosting the function instance. |
| link_to_service_plan | Instructs Farmer to link this webapp to an existing service plan rather than creating a new one. |
| link_to_unmanaged_service_plan | Instructs Farmer to link this Functions instance to an existing service plan that is externally managed, rather than creating a new one. |
| link_to_storage_account | Do not create an automatic storage account; instead, link to a storage account that is created outside of this Functions instance but within this Farmer template. |
| link_to_unmanaged_storage_account | Do not create an automatic storage account; instead, link to an existing storage account that was created external to Farmer. |
| https_only | Disables http for this functions app so that only HTTPS is used. |
| app_insights_name | Sets the name of the automatically-created app insights instance. |
| app_insights_off | Removes any automatic app insights creation, configuration and settings for this webapp. |
| link_to_app_insights | Instead of creating a new AI instance, configure this webapp to point to another AI instance that you are managing yourself. |
| link_to_unmanaged_app_insights | Instructs Farmer to link this functions instance to an existing app insights instance that is externally managed, rather than creating a new one. |
| use_runtime | Sets the runtime of the Functions host. |
| use_extension_version | Sets the extension version of the functions host. |
| operating_system | Sets the operating system of the Functions host. |
| setting | Sets an app setting of the web app in the form "key" "value". |
| secret_setting | Sets a "secret" app setting of the function. You must supply the "key", whilst the value will be supplied as a secure parameter or an ARM expression. |
| settings | Sets a list of app setting of the web app as tuples in the form of ("key", "value"). |
| depends_on | [Sets dependencies for the web app.](../../dependencies/) |
| enable_cors | Enables CORS support for the app. Either specify AllOrigins or a list of valid URIs. |
| enable_cors_credentials | Allows CORS requests with credentials. |
| add_identity | Adds a managed identity to the the Function App. |
| system_identity | Activates the system identity of the Function App. |
| always_on | Stops the app from sleeping if idle for a few minutes of inactivity. |
| worker_process | Specifies whether to set the app to 32 or 64 Bitness. |

#### Post-deployment Builder Keywords
The Functions builder contains special commands that are executed *after* the ARM deployment is completed.

| Keyword | Purpose |
|-|-|
| zip_deploy | Supplying a folder or zip file will instruct Farmer to upload the contents directly to the Azure Functions once the ARM deployment is complete. |


#### Configuration Members

| Member | Purpose |
|-|-|
| PublishingPassword | Gets the ARM expression path to the publishing password of this functions app. |
| StorageAccountKey | Gets the ARM expression path to the storage account key of this functions app. |
| AppInsightsKey | Gets the ARM expression path to the app insights key of this functions app, if it exists. |
| DefaultKey | Gets the ARM expression path for the default key of this functions app. |
| MasterKey | Gets the ARM expression path for the master key of this functions app. |

#### Example
```fsharp
open Farmer
open Farmer.Builders

let myFunctions = functions {
    name "myWebApp"
    service_plan_name "myServicePlan"
    setting "myKey" "aValue"
    app_insights_off
}
```
