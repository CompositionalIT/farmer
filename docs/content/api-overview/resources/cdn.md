#### Overview
The CDN builder is used to create Azure Content Delivery Network instances.

* CDN Profile (`Microsoft.Cdn/profiles`)
* CDN Endpoint (`Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/endpoints`)
* CDN Custom Domain (`Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/endpoints/customDomains`)

There are three builders available:
* The CDN builder, which maps to a CDN profile.
* The Endpoint builder, which creates endpoints and custom domains. Endpoints are created within a CDN.
* The Rule builder, which creates CDN rules with conditions and actions that can be added to an endpoint

#### Example
```fsharp
let isaacWebApp = webApp {
    name "isaacsuperweb"
    app_insights_off
}

let isaacStorage = storageAccount {
    name "isaacsuperstore"
}

let isaacRule = rule {
    name "isaacsuperrule"
    order 1
    when_request_header "issac" Contains ["great"] ToLowercase
    modify_response_header Append "issac" "super"
}

let isaacCdn = cdn {
    name "isaacsupercdn"
    add_endpoints [
        endpoint {
            origin isaacStorage
            optimise_for Cdn.OptimizationType.LargeFileDownload
        }
        endpoint {
            origin isaacWebApp
            disable_http
        }
        endpoint {
            name "custom-endpoint-name"
            origin "mysite.com"
            add_compressed_content [ "text/plain"; "text/html"; "text/css" ]
            query_string_caching_behaviour Cdn.BypassCaching
            add_rule isaacRule
        }
    ]
}
