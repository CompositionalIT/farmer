|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bastion`  | vnet                  | Name of the virtual network the bastion host can access.                                                             |
| `bastion`  | link_to_vnet          | Link to an existing virtual network (no dependsOn emitted.                                                           |
| `bastion`  | scale_units           | Number of scale units when more connections are needed. The default is 2 and more scale units will use the Standard SKU. |

| `bastion`  | enable_shareable_link | lets users connect to a target resource using Azure Bastion without accessing the Azure portal.                      |
| `bastion`  | enable_tunneling      | Set up tunnels through the bastion host so native client tools can be used.                                          |
