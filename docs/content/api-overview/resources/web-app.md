#### Overview
The Web App builder is used to create Azure App Service accounts. It abstracts the Service Plan into the same component, and will also create and configure a linked App Insights resource. If you wish to create a website that connects to an existing service plan, use the `link_to_service_plan` keyword and provide the resource name of the service plan to connect to.

* Web Site (`Microsoft.Web/sites`)
* Server Farms (`Microsoft.Web/serverfarms`)
* Source Controls (`Microsoft.Web/sites/sourcecontrols`)
* Application Insights (`Microsoft.Insights/components`)

#### Web App Builder Keywords
| Applies To | Keyword | Purpose |
|-|-|-|
| Web App | name | Sets the name of the web app. |
| Web App | link_to_service_plan | Instructs Farmer to link this webapp to a Farmer service plan configuration defined elsewhere in your application, rather than creating a new one. |
| Web App | link_to_unmanaged_service_plan | Instructs Farmer to link this webapp to an existing service plan that is externally managed, rather than creating a new one. |
| Web App | app_insights_auto_name | Sets the name of the automatically-created app insights instance. |
| Web App | app_insights_off | Removes any automatic app insights creation, configuration and settings for this webapp. |
| Web App | link_to_app_insights | Instructs Farmer to link this webapp to a Farmer App Insights configuration defined elsewhere in your application, rather than creating a new one. |
| Web App | link_to_unmanaged_app_insights | Instructs Farmer to link this webapp to an existing app insights instance that is externally managed, rather than creating a new one. |
| Web App | run_from_package | Sets the web app to use "run from package" deployment capabilities. |

| Web App | setting | Sets an app setting of the web app in the form "key" "value". |
| Web App | secret_setting | Sets a "secret" app setting of the web app. You must supply the "key", whilst the value will be supplied as a secure parameter. |
| Web App | settings | Sets a list of app setting of the web app as tuples in the form of ("key", "value"). |
| Web App | connection_string | Creates a connection string whose value is supplied as secret parameter, or as an ARM expression in the tupled form of ("key", expr). |
| Web App | connection_strings | Creates a set of connection strings of the web app whose values will be supplied as secret parameters. |
| Web App | https_only | Disables http for this webapp so that only HTTPS is used. |
| Web App | enable_http2 | Configures the webapp to allow clients to connect over http2.0. |
| Web App | disable_client_affinity | Stops the webapp from sending client affinity cookies. |
| Web App | enable_websockets | Configures the webapp to allow clients to connect via websockets. |
| Web App | depends_on | [Sets dependencies for the web app.](../../dependencies/) |
| Web App | docker_image | Sets the docker image to be pulled down from Docker Hub, and the command to execute as a second argument. Automatically sets the OS to Linux. |
| Web App | docker_ci | Turns on continuous integration of the web app from the Docker source repository using a webhook.
| Web App | docker_use_azure_registry | Uses the supplied Azure Container Registry name as the source of the Docker image, instead of Docker Hub. You do not need to specify the full url, but just the name of the registry itself.
| Web App | add_identity | Adds a managed identity to the the Web App. Farmer will automatically set the AZURE_CLIENT_ID application setting to the Client Id of the supplied identity. |
| Web App | system_identity | Activates the system identity of the Web App. |
| Web App | enable_cors | Enables CORS support for the app. Either specify `WebApp.AllOrigins` or a list of valid URIs as strings. |
| Web App | enable_cors_credentials | Allows CORS requests with credentials. |
| Web App | source_control | Given a github repository URI and branch name, configures the web app to automatically deploy those files to the web app |
| Web App | disable_source_control_ci | Disables continuous integration from source control on push |
| Web App | enable_source_control_ci | Enables continuous integration from source control on push |
| Web App | add_extension | Adds the named extension to the Web App |
| Web App | automatic_logging_extension | Enables or disables automatically adding the ASP .NET logging extension for netcore apps (defaults to on). |
| Web App | worker_process | Specifies whether to set the web app to 32 or 64 Bitness. |
| Web App | always_on | Sets the "Always On" flag. |
| Service Plan | service_plan_name | Sets the name of the service plan. If not set, uses the name of the web app postfixed with "-plan". |
| Service Plan | runtime_stack | Sets the runtime stack. |
| Service Plan | operating_system | Sets the operating system. If Linux, App Insights configuration settings will be omitted as they are not supported by Azure App Service. |
| Service Plan | sku | Sets the sku of the service plan. |
| Service Plan | worker_size | Sets the size of the service plan worker. |
| Service Plan | number_of_workers | Sets the number of instances on the service plan. |

> **Farmer also comes with a dedicated Service Plan builder** that contains all of the above keywords that apply to a Service Plan.
>
> Use this builder if you wish to have an explicit and clear separation between your web app and service plan. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the service plan keywords that exist directly in the web app builder, and let Farmer handle the connections between them.

#### Post-deployment Builder Keywords
The Web App builder contains special commands that are executed *after* the ARM deployment is completed.

| Keyword | Purpose |
|-|-|
| zip_deploy | Supplying a folder or zip file will instruct Farmer to upload the contents directly to the App Service once the ARM deployment is complete. |

#### Configuration Members

| Member | Purpose |
|-|-|
| PublishingPassword | Gets the ARM expression path to the publishing password of this web app. |
| ServicePlan | Gets the Resource Name of the service plan for this web app. |
| AppInsights | Gets the Resource Name of the service plan for the AI resource linked to this web app. |
| SystemIdentity | Gets the system-created managed principal for the web app. It must have been enabled using the system_identity keyword. |

#### Key Vault integration
The Web App builder comes with special integration into KeyVault. By activating KeyVault integration, the web app builder can automatically link to, or even create, a full KeyVault instance. All Secret or ARM Expression-based Settings (e.g. a setting that links to the Key of a Storage Account) will automatically be redirected to KeyVault. The value will be stored in KeyVault and the system identity will be activated and provided into the KeyVault with GET permissions. Lastly, Web App app settings will remain in place, using the Azure App Service built-in KeyVault redirection capabilities.

The following keywords exist on the web app:

| Member | Purpose |
|-|-|
| use_keyvault | Tells the web app to create a brand new KeyVault for this App Service's secrets. |
| link_to_keyvault | Tells the web app to use an existing Farmer-managed KeyVault which you have defined elsewhere. All secret settings will automatically be mapped into KeyVault. |
| link_to_unmanaged_keyvault | Tells the web app to use an existing non-Farmer managed KeyVault which you have defined elsewhere.  All secret settings will automatically be mapped into KeyVault. |

#### Examples

A basic web application.

```fsharp
open Farmer
open Farmer.Builders
open Farmer.WebApp

let myWebApp = webApp {
    name "myWebApp"
    service_plan_name "myServicePlan"
    setting "myKey" "aValue"
    sku WebApp.Sku.B1
    always_on
    app_insights_off
    worker_size Medium
    number_of_workers 3
    run_from_package
    system_identity
}
```

Using a managed Key Vault instance with automatic secret mapping.

```fsharp
open Farmer
open Farmer.Builders

// Create a basic storage account
let data = storageAccount {
    name "mystorage"
}

// Create a web application with a sensitive setting of storage key and an explicit "secret" setting
// which will be passed through by ARM parameter.
let wa = webApp {
    name "isaac"
    setting "key" "value"
    setting "storagekey" data.Key
    link_to_keyvault (ResourceName "isaacvault")
}

// Create a key vault instance and explicitly grant the web application access to it.
let v = keyVault {
    name "isaacvault"
    add_access_policy (AccessPolicy.create (wa.SystemIdentity.PrincipalId, [ KeyVault.Secret.Get; KeyVault.Secret.List ]))
}
```
