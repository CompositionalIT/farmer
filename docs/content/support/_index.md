The creators of Farmer, [Compositional IT](https://compositional-it.com), offer a professional **fully managed support package** which we strongly recommend for any organisations using Farmer on a commercial basis. It includes:

* **Prioritised resolution** of any bugs. If you find a bug that's blocking you, we'll prioritise it and release a hot fix as soon as it's ready.
* **Prioritised resolution** and escalation of issues. If there's a possible issue or question, we'll prioritise dealing with it.
* **Prioritised feature requests**: Get new features that are important to you added first.
* **Personalised support** and guidance via email, telephone or video. Speak to one of our team for advice and best practices on how to best manage deployments.
* **Discounts** on our [F# and Azure training and coaching services](https://www.compositional-it.com/training-coaching/)
